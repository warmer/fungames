Usage:
YahooSportsScraper.exe [options [params]]
[options] can be one any of the following:
	get_teams (no parameters)
		Gets the list of teams from the default Yahoo! Sports teams URL
		and loads them into the default hard-coded database
		loads tblteams with:
			* team (varchar(255))
			* yahooID (varchar(3))
	
	get_games [[poll_period nnn] [start_team]]
		Uses the team codes that are retrieved with the get_teams option
		to poll each team page from Yahoo! Sports using the default
		hard-coded URL
		(http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/basketball/teams/[TEAMCODE])
		Note that this doesn't actually get scores; it simply populates
		the 'tblgames' database table with the following information:
			* Yahoo! Sports gid (bigint(20))
			* Yahoo! Sports team ID for the home team (varchar(3))
			* Yahoo! Sports team ID for the visiting team (varchar(3))
			* home score (int(10))
			* visiting score (int(10))
			* date the game was played (date)
		poll_period is the number of seconds between eatch page fetch
		start_team is the three-digit string corresponding to
			the _last_ team that was scraped (it is non-inclusive)
	
	get_roster [poll_period nnn]
		Uses the team codes that are retrieved with the get_teams option
		to poll each roster page from Yahoo! Sports using the default
		hard-coded URL
		(http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/basketball/teams/[TEAMCODE]/roster)
		poll_period is the number of seconds between eatch page fetch
		Note: for now, it only downloads the file and does nothing else with it
	
	get_team_stats [poll_period nnn]
		Uses the team codes that are retrieved with the get_teams option
		to poll each team's stat page from Yahoo! Sports using the default
		hard-coded URL
		(http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/basketball/teams/[TEAMCODE]/stats)
		poll_period is the number of seconds between eatch page fetch
		Note: for now, it only downloads the file and does nothing else with it
	
	get_boxscores [[poll_period nnn] [[min_boundary] [[max_boundary] [proxy]]]]]
		Uses the Yahoo! Sports gid table to download each game's boxscore
		poll_period is the number of seconds between each page fetch
			If poll_period is zero, the scraper only uses cached files
			(doesn't pull new ones)
		min_boundary is a number like yyyyMMdd0000
		max_boundary is a number like yyyyMMdd0000
		proxy is an address like http://nodiff.net/urldump.php?url=

	process_local_boxscores
		Populates the 'tblplayers' table with stats pulled from the
		local cache of boxscores. Inserts:
				* Name (varchar(50))
				* Yahoo! Sports player ID (int(6))
				* Yahoo! Sports team ID (varchar(3))
				* Yahoo! Sports gid (bigint(12))
				* Min (int(11))
				* FGM (int(11))
				* FGA (int(11))
				* TPM (int(11))
				* TPA (int(11))
				* FTM (int(11))
				* FTA (int(11))
				* Off (int(11))
				* Reb (int(11))
				* Ast (int(11))
				* TRN (int(11))
				* Stl (int(11))
				* Blk (int(11))
				* PF (int(11))
				* Pts (int(11))
		
	check_games
